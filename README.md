# Legion_IX

Legion_IX is a .NET Windows Forms APP variant of `DLWMS` online Student service system of my Faculty. The only purpose Behind the project is learning C# itself, mastering the use of Visual Studio 2022 IDE and all it has to offer, incorporating different technologies and generally adapting and implementing everything and anything that comes to my mind. I wanted to widen my knowledge and invest into practical work, so this is the result.

I continue to inovate, implement new functions, optimize/refactor code and apply all newly gathered knowledge into this project.

The main pillar of my application is MongoDB Atlas, from which information is pulled and uploaded for all users accordingly. I have put plenty, of which MongoDB has to offer, into my project and must say that working with it was a challenging but yet sweet delight. With Mongo as well, I continue to learn and apply the learned further.

I have also used SQLite to store downloaded documents (currently only supporting `.pdf` and `.rar` files). The reason behind it was a wish to create and work with a localized DB for learning purposes and manually creating tables and structuring data.

My main goal was for all my functions to be interconnected and to depend on each other to a certain degree.

In case you're wondering, I've named the project symbolically after the ninth hispanic Roman Legion who's purpose was extensive during Roman conquest of Britannia. The Legion (consisting of thousands infantry men) was suddenly discluded from all records. I deemed the story interesting so the name stuck. Due to my being lost and undefined with what project I would want to make, and given the fact that most of the implementations were not planned, I've named my project after the mentioned, once very capable, Legion.
